/employees page should have an option to add an Employee #225

Okay there's a lot of fluff to that page, I'm sure we don't need that file THAT big on /employees.
app/employees/page.tsx

What use cases is it handling?

But I just want to add the feature, so I'm going to add onto it first then try to trim it.

...

So I changed the file name from add-employee to add-user which makes more sense semantically.
