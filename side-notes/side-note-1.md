Side note: Dilemma:

If we want to ship fast we will skip features which enhance UI but if we commit and get onto the next part, the features we skipped which will be added on later will be much tougher to add on due to the fact that we have to re-establish the app in that 'mindspace' and 'codespace' to create said feature.


Okay, the work notes should be kind of like Gist and like Git at the same time, I like the version control of git but the quick updates of gist.


I want it to be on a website you like host but the issue is that, I'm broke and so are a lot of new devs so it needs to be cheap.


Side side notes: 
Chess is not a good game for pre-coding because I have been playing Chess all day and I still don't feel like coding.
